Design Thoughts:
- Item: a discrete thing to be brought on a trip
- Item Categories: general item classification (e.g. clothing, climbing gear, overnight gear)
  - Think of this as the logical grouping you'd use when laying everything out to pack.
  - Each item is associated with *one* category.
- Trip Parameters: parameters of a trip (e.g. activities, conditions, length of outing)
 - Each item can be associated with many trip parameters.
- We utilize "Save" buttons whenever editing primitives to provide a logical place for validation.
- Deleting an item/trip parameter/packing list only removes that item and associations to it.
  It does not cleanup other objects that then have nothing associated with them.

TODO:
- Undo Toasts
  - for deletions
- Add (uniquely named) item categories
  - Display items based on category (will require adding category activity, fragment, etc.)
 ==========
- Removing trip parameter from activity removes items only associated with that trip parameter
- Ability to export/import data as json
- Drag and drop to re-order items in a packing list
- Add existing item to list without having to edit trip parameters
  - completion suggestions on item name; if user selects one or types existing name ask, load remaining details for that item?
- Ability to share lists
- Code Cleanup
  - Standardize naming (e.g. buttons, codes, ids - camelCase vs snake_case?)
  - Enhance logging
  - Address all warnings
- Maintainability improvements
  - Testing
  - Documentation
- Add item quantities/weights
