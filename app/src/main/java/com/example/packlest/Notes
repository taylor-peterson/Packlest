Design Thoughts:
- Item: a discrete thing to be brought on a trip
- Item Categories: general item classification (e.g. clothing, climbing gear, overnight gear)
  - Think of this as the logical grouping you'd use when laying everything out to pack.
  - Each item is associated with precisely one category.
- Trip Parameters: parameters of a trip (e.g. activities, conditions, length of outing)
 - Each item can be associated with many trip parameters.
- We utilize "Save" buttons whenever editing primitives to provide a logical place for validation.
- Deleting an item/trip parameter/packing list only removes that item and associations to it.
  It does not cleanup other objects that then have nothing associated with them.
- Removing a trip parameter from an activity similarly does not remove items only associated with
  that trip parameter. Rather, it will only result in future items added to that trip parameter
  not being added to said trip.
- Decided against drag & drop  and export/import for now until it proves needed.

TODO:
- Display items based on category
- Sort ArrayLists
- Add item quantities/weights
